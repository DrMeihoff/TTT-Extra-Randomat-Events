This addon will add more randomat events to your TTT Game. It requires
[Randomat 2.0](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1406495040)

## Events

### **I'm The Captain Now**

This event will kill the detective when they kill an innocent, and
respawn the innocent as the detective.

### **Contagious Morality**

This event will turn each role into a 'team'. When someone kills another
person, they will respawn as the attacker's role, so for traitors to win
the round, they must turn everyone else into traitors, the same goes for
innocent, and other roles.

### **Petrify!**

This event will turn everyone's player model into the default source
player model, the one that looks like stone, and make everyone's
footsteps sound like stone.

### **Realistic Recoil**

This will add a back force to weapons, based on their damage, and amount
of bullets shot. This can allow you to fly by shooting your weapon.

### **Hilarity Ensues**

This event will make jesters / swappers explode when killed by a
traitor, and will then respawn both the traitor, and the jester /
swapper (as a traitor).

### **... That's Lame**

This event does absolutely nothing.

### **Pinball Players**

This event will fire players away from each other if they touch, if you
jump at another player, can be used to launch yourself somewhere.

### **Don't Miss...**

(Previously I'm the accuracy now) This event will remove health from you
if you miss a shot, and give you health if you hit.

### **Cremation**

This event will set dead bodies on fire shortly after death, causing
them to disappear, unless you put them out.

### **Unbelievable Guilt**

This event will force a players head down for a short period of time if
they kill a member of the same team.
